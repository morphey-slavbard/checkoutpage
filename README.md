Variable to be created in FX

* btn_title - this changes the the title of button e.g. from "add card details" to "complete order"<br>
* btn_class - this swaps the css class of the button - two styles are created in the css for you button-5 and button-23, i got these from https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples ( I framed it around the orginal button is not quite on brand, and the second one is on brand.

You could also set up another variable that could change from  display none to block. it is currently hard coded.

You need to input the SDK key in line 19 of index1.html, there is no instal of the sdk as we use a script, but for demo perposes it does the job.
